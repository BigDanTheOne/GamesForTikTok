#### (a wikiHow Picture Guessing Game)

## What is this?
Damn.dog is a game where you are shown an actual wikiHow illustration, and have to figure out which actual wikiHow article it belongs to. [Pull requests](https://github.com/AhoyLemon/damn.dog/pull/new/gh-pages) welcome.

## What's with the name?
The name actually came first. I was surprised to find out that the domain `damn.dog` was not already taken, so I had to get it for myself. After that point I had to try to figure out what to do with it. This is what came to mind.

## Who worked on this?
[Lemon](https://thefpl.us/meet/lemon) made the game itself. Some others have added some illustrations...
